# neon-data-api

NEON's data API is currently under development (v0); this is a forum to share ideas and code.

The API is hosted at http://data.neonscience.org/data-api and delivers data product and location information in JSON format. We’re working on building it out to include data.

Please feel free to give the API a whirl and give us feedback via this repository’s Issues section. We may not be able to accommodate all requests, but we're very interested in what you think the most important capabilities of a NEON API would be and what you would use it for. If you dive into writing a script or building an application, share it as an example! And of course also let us know if you run into any bugs. Just note that the API may change rapidly without notice during development, so you won’t want to build anything critical with it.

There are a couple of small examples in using the API:
